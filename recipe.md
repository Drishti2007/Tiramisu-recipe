Steps to make tiramisu: 
first, beat your heavy cream using the electric whisk until stiff peaks form.
next, add condensed milk, to make the creamn sweet (quantity can be adjusted according to taste)
Once your cream is ready, make your coffee mixture using 1 cup of hot water and 3 tablespoons of coffee granules(again, quantity can be adjusted according to taste.)
Carefully dip your ladyfinger buscuits into your coffee mixture and start arranging them in your plating dish. 
Alternate layers of cream and coffee biscuits until you are done.
Complete plating by sprinkling some cocoa powder as the top layer of your tiramisu using a sieve.
Set your dish in the fridge and wait for about 4-5 hours before consuming.
YOUR TIRAMISU IS READY!
